# Docker Compose configuration for Nim development environment
# This file defines the services, networks, and volumes for the Nim dev environment.
#
# Usage:
# - Build and start: docker-compose up -d
# - Stop: docker-compose down
# - Rebuild: docker-compose up -d --build
# - View logs: docker-compose logs -f
#
# The configuration uses volumes to persist data between container restarts.

    # Volume mounts
    # Maps directories between host (Windows) and container (Linux)
    volumes:
      # Mount parent directory to /projects in container for access to sibling projects
      # Current directory (NimBase) is accessible at /projects/NimBase
      # Customize this mount point to fit your workflow:
      #   - For entire D: drive: source: D:\ target: /d
      #   - For user directory: source: ${USERPROFILE} target: /home
      #   - For specific folder: source: D:\MyProjects target: /projects
      - type: bind
        source: ..
        target: /projects

      # Workspace folder points to the NimBase directory inside /projects
      # This is overridden by devcontainer.json workspaceFolder setting

      # Persist Nim packages across container rebuilds
      # This avoids re-downloading packages every time

      # Persist Nim compiler cache for faster builds
      - nim-cache:/root/.cache/nim

      # Persist bash history for convenience
      - bash-history:/root/.bash_history_mount

      # Mount Docker socket for Docker-in-Docker (DinD) support
      # This allows running docker commands inside the container
      # The Docker daemon runs on the host, we just use the CLI
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

      # Mount SSH keys from Windows host for Git authentication
      # This allows using your existing SSH keys for Git operations
      # Windows path is converted by Docker Desktop
      - ${USERPROFILE}/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro

      # Mount Git configuration from Windows host
      # Preserves your Git user.name, user.email, and other settings
      - ${USERPROFILE}/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig:ro

      # Persist custom zsh configuration across container rebuilds
      # Add your customizations directly in the container at /root/.zshrc.local
